# VLSI Homework and Project Portfolio

This repository contains all the assignments and projects I completed during my VLSI course in 2024. The topics include basic logic gate, delay analysis, combinational circuit design, sequential circuit design, and both pre- and post-simulation. We followed a full-custom design flow throughout the course.

The main tools used were **Composer**, **HSPICE**, and **Laker**.

## ðŸ”¸ Homework and Project List

- **HW1** â€“ Basic logic gate design and pre-simulation
- **HW2** â€“ Delay estimation and inverter chain simulation
- **HW3** â€“ D flip-flop (DFF) design and simulation
- **HW4** â€“ LFSR / PRBS generator design and simulation
- **Midterm Project** â€“ Thermometer-to-Binary Converter (TBC) design and simulation
- **Final Project** â€“ Random Interleaved Sampling (RIS) method design and simulation
