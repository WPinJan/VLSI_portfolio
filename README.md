# VLSI Homework and Project Portfolio

This repository contains all the assignments and projects I completed during my VLSI course in 2024. The topics include basic logic gate, delay analysis, combinational circuit design, sequential circuit design, and both pre- and post-simulation. We followed a full-custom design flow throughout the course.

The main tools used were **Composer**, **HSPICE**, and **Laker**.

## ðŸ”¸ Homework and Project List

- **HW1** â€“ Basic logic gate design and pre-simulation
- **HW2** â€“ Delay estimation and inverter chain simulation
- **HW3** â€“ D flip-flop (DFF) design and simulation
- **HW4** â€“ LFSR / PRBS generator design and simulation
- **Midterm Project** â€“ Thermometer-to-Binary Converter (TBC) design and simulation
- **Final Project** â€“ Random Interleaved Sampling (RIS) method design and simulation

Note: Most simulations and layouts were performed using the 0.18Î¼m process. However, in HW4, additional simulation and layout were also conducted using the 16nm process (ADFP).  
Due to confidentiality agreements, results and screenshots related to the 16nm process could not be taken from the workstation, and therefore are not included in the HW4 report.
